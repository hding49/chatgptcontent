The frontend development follows a structured MVC architecture using React, Redux, React Router, and Bootstrap for the user interface. React Router manages client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different views within the Single Page Application (SPA). Redux, a state management library, orchestrates the application's global state, facilitating data flow and interactions between components.

Node.js acts as a proxy server, connecting the frontend to the backend services, establishing a secure and efficient communication channel. The backend, organized in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, handles business logic and data processing, providing RESTful APIs consumed by the frontend.

The Model layer manages data persistence and retrieval, interacting with the database through an ORM or other data access mechanisms. Views are implemented using React components, styled and structured with Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Controllers handle user inputs, orchestrating interactions between views and models, ensuring a seamless flow of data and actions.

This design fosters a scalable, maintainable, and modular codebase, promoting separation of concerns and facilitating development, testing, and future enhancements.
